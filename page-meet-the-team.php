    <h1>Meet the team!</h1>
        <br>
    <h2>Bill, Karen and the team are proud to introduce their new premises in St Albans, 961 Colombo Street - Piston Cranky Motors Ltd!</h2>
    <p>At Piston Cranky Motors Ltd it's a friendly atmosphere. Customers call in for a chat and a cuppa, and often drop off cakes, biscuits, wine (Karen loves that), beers for the boys and everyone seems to know what day fish â€˜n' chip day is - one of their customers makes the best plum sauce for the occasion!<br>
        <br>
        <h3>Bill</h3> Began his career as an apprentice for Tom Hutt, the owner of Tom's Garage in Papanui at the age of 19. After six years there, he moved on to Team Hutchison Ford where he spent another six years. Following this, he managed the Mobil Wigram workshop for five years, where he met his lovely wife Karen.
        <br>
        Bill became the manager of the Cranford Street garage for Chris Rose until 2001, when Bill and Karen along with Bill's parents, Dot and John, bought Aylesford Automotive in Westminster Street as a family business. Dot and John (known as Chook and George) retired halfway through 2005 and Bill and Karen became the sole owners.<br>
        <br>
                <h3>Bruce</h3> Is the WOF inspector and has been with Bill and Karen since 2005. He is pleasant to work with, knows his stuff and takes all the flack the rest of the staff throw at him. He loves it.</p>
